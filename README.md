# MIT-OpenCourseWare
Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python
My name is Joe, and I'm a second year biological sciences undergraduate at the University of Exeter. At the Gatsby Plant Science Summer School, funded my the generous Gatsby Foundation, I was encouraged by pHD students and doctors to spend my summer learning to code- an increasingly valuable skill. So, here I am! 
This repository will feature my rookie coding and tests, guided by "MIT's OpenCourseWare: Introduction to Computer Science and Coding in Python" instructed by Dr. Ana Bell, Prof. Eric Grimson & Prof. John Guttag as taught in 2016. 
I welcome any tips, tricks and affirmations from the coding community and wish myself good luck! :)
