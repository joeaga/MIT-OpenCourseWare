# example STRINGS 
x = "Time's running out"
name = "Mike"
# using the '+' operon to combine strings doesn't include spaces.
warning = x + " " + name
print(warning)
echo = x + (" " + name)*3
print(echo)

# example OUTPUT
b = 27
print(b)
print(b*3)
# when you sign a variable as a string (even if it is a number), the '*' operon will treat the number as a string and repeat.
b_str = str(b)
print(b_str)
print(b_str*3)

# example INPUT
numprompt = input("What's you're favourite number? ") #note: adding the space makes it look cleaner on the console.
print (5 * numprompt) 
# input() always returns a string, so for arithmatic you want to assign the string as an int.
numprompt = int(numprompt)
print (5 * numprompt)
